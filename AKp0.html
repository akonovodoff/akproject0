  <p> Willow Wilhelmina Weissert was born May 3rd, 2018 in Charlotte, NC. </br>
    This little mut of a pup had one sister, and lived on the streets for the first couple days of her life along with her mother.
    Willow's little family of three was eventually taken to a shelter where vets began attending the dogs' needs; all three dogs were starving and covered in fleas and ticks.
    Willow and her sister additionally had worms in their little baby bellies. </p>
  <p>Luckily, this shelter ran a foster program where dogs were fostered out to loving and caring families.
    Sadly for Willow and her sister, this opportunity came at the price of leaving their mother.
    The small family of three sad their goodbyes, and off the puppies went to move into their new home. Their foster family came with a mom, a dad, and two older dogs,<strong> Callie and Stella HYPERLINK TO FRIEND PAGE </strong>, to play with.
    Little did Willow and her sister know that one day, they too would be separated; each finding their forever home in different parts of the country.</p>
  <p> Nevertheless, all the dogs quickly became good friends. Willow's foster mom and dad, Nicole and Andrew, took great care of all four dogs;
    they went to parks, they went on hikes, they played in the pool in the backyard. These outdoor <strong> activites ADD LINK TO FAV ACTIVITES PAGE </strong> remain some of Willow's favorites. Since the puppies had great mentors, they quickly became house trained, and learned a few tricks as well. </p>
  <p> Willow's sister was adopted first by an elderly man native to Charlotte. After thoughtful consideration, Nicole and Andrew decided that would be an excellent home for Willow's sister.
    Where Willow was energetic and rembunctuous, her sister was calm and docile.
    Willow and her sister said their goodbyes, and Willow continued to live with Nicole, Andrew, Callie, and Stella, waiting to find her forever home. This is where my fiance and I come in...</p>
  <p> I'm sitting at my desk at work. It's almost 6 o'lock in New York City so I'm starting to wrap up my day. That's when I get a call from Greg;
    his sister has been fostering a puppy, and his mom thinks she'd be perfect for us. We'd have to make a decision quickly because his sister was going to move to New Jersey soon, and they wanted
    to get the puppy a home before they made the move. </p>
  <p> Now, it's important to note that Greg and I were not necessarily on the market to get a dog; we were in the middle of planning a move from Brooklyn to the Upper East Side.
    Although not a big move, it's considerably harder to find an apartment that is dog-friendly in Manahattan.
    We also had no idea who this dog was! Was she big? Small? Energetic? Calm? Trained? Apparently not knowing much about the dog did not pahse us. We trusted Greg's mom's opinion on the pup and
    committed to adopting the puppy. </p>
  <p><em> One application later, we became the forever family for Ms. Willow. </em></p>
  <p> To clarify, I'd like to point out that Nicole, Willow's foster mom, is actually Greg's sister.
    Willow is still best friends with Callie and Stella (see Willow's friends here), and we constantly arrange puppy playdates for all the girls to get together. </p>
  <p> Although Willow began life as a southern belle, she quickly became a city-dog before we ultimately moved out to the suburbs.
    She's lived an interesting life so far, and Greg and I are blessed to have her. </P>
