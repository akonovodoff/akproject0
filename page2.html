  <h1> Willow's Best Friends </h1>
  <P> As I mentioned in <strong> Willow's Story, ADD LINK TO FIRST PAGE </strong> Willow was fostered with a wonderful family who already had two dogs.
    These dogs, Callie and Stella, would eventually become her cousins. Willow also has two other cousins, Shelby and Rylee. </p>
